# Heat and Mass Transfer Project


This repository contains data and calculations for heat and mass transfer problems. The project uses experimental data for various fluids (saturated water, air, and oil) and performs interpolation to calculate fluid properties at different temperatures (and pressures).

## Colab Notebook

[Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xmvhjNzo625Tm6akyEM9XyQpJfHbZ1O2?usp=sharing)

### Features:
- **Interpolation of Fluid Properties**: Calculates properties like thermal conductivity, viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and more.
- **Custom Inputs**: The notebook allows input of temperature (and pressure, where applicable) to retrieve accurate property values using linear interpolation.
- **Data**: Properties for saturated water, air, and oil are available for quick reference and computation.

## How to Use

1. Open the Colab notebook using the link above.
2. Input the temperature (and pressure, if applicable) to get the desired property values.
3. View the results, which include various properties such as kinematic viscosity, thermal diffusivity, etc., for the chosen fluid.
